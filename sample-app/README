# Notes
## Reinstall Go and VS Code
- redownload the correct arm64 versions for go and vscode
- manually installed go from the [go list all versions and selected “ARM64”](https://go.dev/dl/).  Homebrew default installed amd64, which is for the older intel chips, not the new Apple Silicon M3 chip.
- I also had to manually download the VS Code for apple silicon chip. Do not install the default Universal Build, [but instead the Apple Silicon version](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads).

## Set up VS Code for Go
- Download Rosetta
    - confluence doc: https://lightstep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EPD/pages/2652274738/Downloading+Rosetta+for+x86+-+arm64+translation
    - command: `softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
- Install Go extension
    - `Command + Shift + X`
    - Install 'Go'
- Install Go tools
    - `Command + Shift + P`
    - Type "Go: Install/Update Tools”
    - Select ALL the tools and install
